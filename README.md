# bkachava.github.io - GitHub Pages

Repository for publishing different visualizations: 

 - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

   HTML, CSS, Bootstrap were used for building this dashboard, with a page for each plot and a means by which
   the user can navigate between them. These pages contained the visualizations created in the [PyWeather - APIs assignment](https://github.com/bkachava/pandas/tree/master/PyWeather) and their corresponding explanations. Also, 
   includes a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page to view 
   the data used to build them.
